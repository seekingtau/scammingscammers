Program that pointlessly uses threading to scams scammers by flooding phishing pages with fake information.

## Disclaimer
Please do not use this code for any malicious purpose. I am not responsible if you get in trouble for doing stupid stuff with my code - this script solely is meant to randomise name and email data for websites, and is only here as a demo of what you could do. I highly suggest you do not do that, and certainly do not use it on non-scamming sites.
